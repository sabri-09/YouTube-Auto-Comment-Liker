2. **Core Logic** â€” The system uses UI Automator and Accessibility APIs to scroll through comments and tap the like button under each comment.  
3. **Output or Action** â€” Liked comments are logged with timestamps and account identifiers.  
4. **Other functionalities** â€” Error handling, retries, and activity reporting are integrated to maintain performance across large-scale runs.
